FAA Data in MySQL Format

Under Development

## Synopsis

In July 2023, the US FAA began publishing National Airspace System Resource (NASR) data in CSV Format with well-defined data types.

In January 2024, we created "FC2S" which is also available soon via PHP Composer, which imports this data when released and exports the .sql file, zips it, and pushes it to this repository.

## License

The data here is licensed under the same license the original data is released under.
