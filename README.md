FAA Data in MySQL Format

Under Development

## Synopsis

In July 2023, the US FAA began publishing National Airspace System Resource (NASR) data in CSV Format with well-defined data types.

In January 2024, we created the "FAA CSV to SQL" Project - "FC2S" which is also available soon via PHP Composer, but you can see the early source code [Here](https://github.com/aifrus/fc2s) which imports this data when released and exports the .sql file, zips it, and pushes it to this repository.

## License

The data here is licensed under the same license the original data is released under.
